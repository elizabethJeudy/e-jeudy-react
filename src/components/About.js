						Hey, I'm Elizabeth and I am newly passionate about building things
						for the web. My journey originally began when I was a middle
						schooler customizing MySpace themes which taught me about HTML &
						CSS, and never thought anything more of it. Fast foward to 10+ years
						later and who would have guessed!
						<br />
						<br />
						The beginning of 2022 is where it truly piqued my interest, however
						like most career switchers, I didn't believe learning how to program
						would be a concept I could grasp.
						<br />
						Since that interest, I've been able to reignite my passion for
						creativity and combine it with creating web applications. I've
						developed a couple of projects that you'll find below which I am
						proud of. I am now looking for a junior developer position, but in
						the meantime I will continue creating and learning.
						<br />
						<br />
						When I am not coding, I am reading a new book, or on a travel
						adventure. If you'd like to work on a project together or want to
						gain new a developer friend, feel free to{" "}
