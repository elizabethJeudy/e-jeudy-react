## Description:

##### This site is the homepage for my portfoio. It will show previous projects I've worked on, links with social media, and contact info.

## What I Learned:

1. _\* symbol_ is used to render given styles on every element on the page

2. _scroll-behavior_ property allows you to animate the scroll position when user clicks within a scroll box

3. _webkit_ is a css extension that allows content to render properly across Chrome and Safari browsers

4. _download attribute_ allows you to specify a target wrapped in the anchor tag that will download when user click on the hyperlink

5. _viewport-percentage length unit_ is based on the browsers default viewport size (which is the browsers window minus the scroll and tool bars)

6. _REM vs EM_ although these have the same output, REM depends on the root element in HTML; for example - the html font size is 16px and you change .p tag unit to 1rem, it will equal 16. EM unit is less effective because there is more calculating involved and it is likely to run into issues with responsiveness while using media queries.

7. _display:grid_ is similar to flexbox however they differ where flexbox is design for either rows and columns and grid designs both at the same time. Along with _display: grid_ comes one of the properties _grid-template-columns_ and _gap_ which was exciting to use
